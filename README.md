# Taiwan-Waste-Classifier
Using AI to Address Taiwan's Waste Classification &amp; Recycling Management

# Project Description
This project aims to develop an AI model tailored specifically for waste classification in Taiwan. Existing AI models from other countries often lack specificity for the unique types of waste commonly found in Taiwan and do not align with Taiwanese waste classification regulations. Taiwanâ€™s recycling rate has reached an impressive 60% as of 2022, however, without a correct and precise classification at the source, recycled materials would be downgraded or treated as garbage upon reaching recycling plants. 
To address this issue, we have curated a comprehensive dataset composed of images of various waste items collected in Taipei, and combined with other external sources. Our AI model will accurately identify and classify the different types of waste found in Taiwan, providing clear instructions on their appropriate disposal methods.
